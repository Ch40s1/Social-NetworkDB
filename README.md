# Social-NetworkDB

## Description

This project is part of a template that uses technologies commonly used in the development of full-stack social networking applications. It focuses on building the foundational API for a social network web application.

It uses MongoDB a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

## Installation

To get started
1. clone the repository
* `git clone <repo url>`
2. Install the dependencies
* `npm install`
3. Start the server
* `npm start`
## Usage

This project is a template for a backend-focused social network. As a result, it does not include a front-end. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use tools like Postman or Insomnia to serve as the front-end.

It is still possible to use the browser to make requests.

Both methods use the api routes in order to make the requests.
